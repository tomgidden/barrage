BARRAGE

BBC Micro game by P.R.Cox and S.Barrow

This is an early version, so please report any bugs.

There are a lot of quirks in the original game which I've not only
chosen not to fix, but actually replicate. The problem being that if I try
to tidy the game up, it's essentially a never-ending task. 

Where do you draw the line? 

I've decided to be faithful as I can be without spending too long
on irrelevant details. Yes, I could make it practically pixel-perfect,
but you might as well just run the emulator. This is close.

Even so, there are some bugs I've added, eg. mid-air explosions when it 
reaches the edge of the screen. I'll get to them.


Oh, and I'm fully intending to go through and comment it properly, as well
as refactoring for clarity.  I want this to be nice, neat, simple code,
although some details of the original game may require some hacky bits.

Any advice on building a no-code backend for WebSockets to make this
two-player between two browsers would be appreciated. I don't want to have
to pay a fortune in hosting.
