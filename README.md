BARRAGE

BBC Micro game by P.R.Cox and S.Barrow

JavaScript translation by Tom Gidden

This is an early version, so please report any bugs.

There are a lot of quirks in the original game which I've not only
chosen not to fix, but actually replicate. The problem being that if I try
to tidy the game up, it's essentially a never-ending task. 

Where do you draw the line? 

I've decided to be faithful as I can be without spending too long
on irrelevant details. Yes, I could make it practically pixel-perfect,
but you might as well just run the emulator. This is close.

Even so, there are some bugs I've added, eg. mid-air explosions when it 
reaches the edge of the screen. I'll get to them.
